# Face Recognition based Attendance System

- Training

    - Build database of known and required faces
    - Collect images
    - Face Recognition using MTCNN
    - Cropping of face
    - Embeddings extracted using FaceNet
    - Database formulation

- Testing

    - Test image loaded
    - Images in face identified
    - Embeddings extracted for test image faces
    - Compared with database for similarity
    - Identified
    - Export attendance by validation of members in the image
